## ABOUT MYSELF
- My name is Kyle Inigo Z. Torres, I am a grade 9 student at Ateneo De Naga Junior High School. This pandemic has taught me a lot to know and explore life in my town. This is the first ever that I learned how to create a website using GitHub, since I know now, With this activity, I can share the hobbies that I have discovered during the outbreak
### HOBBIES DURING PANDEMIC
- Biking with my friends. Biking with them helped me a lot to discover so many hidden gems in our town which is in Goa. Also, I realized that when I am riding a bike, all of my problems are vanishing away and help me to clear the stresses in my mind. Here is the sample video of me riding a bike.https://www.instagram.com/reel/ClY-ocNjPsC/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link

### SONGS TO PLAY AFTER A TIRING DAY
 - One of my favorite artist is Kanye West and whenever im listening to his musical piece, It hypes up my energy all throughout the day
